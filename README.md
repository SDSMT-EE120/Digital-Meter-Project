# Project Overview and Helpers 

## Overview

The multimeter is an indispensable tool for any electronics project, as it helps overcome countless challenges during project completion. This project will demonstrate how to create a cost-effective digital multimeter using an Adafruit ESP32-S3 REV TFT board. This multimeter is capable of measuring voltage, current, resistance, and capacitance. Upon completing the project, you will have your own multimeter and a better understanind of Ohm's Law.
